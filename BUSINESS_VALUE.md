## 🎯 The Problem We're Solving

### Imagine This Scenario:

> *Sarah has a great idea for a new app. She wants to know:*
> - *Is this idea good enough to pursue?*
> - *Who are my competitors?*
> - *What risks should I worry about?*
> - *Where can I find a co-founder?*

**Currently, Sarah has two options:**

| Option | Cost | Time | Outcome |
|--------|------|------|---------|
| **Hire a Consultant** | $1,500 - $5,000 | 2-4 weeks | Professional report |
| **Do It Herself** | Free | 40+ hours | Incomplete research |

**Neither option is ideal.** Consultants are expensive. Self-research is exhausting and often incomplete.
